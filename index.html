<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
  Hi!  As I said, my name is Shiv Mishra, and I am currently a Freshman in my second-semester majoring in Finance at The University of Texas at Austin, in the McCombs School of Business. I was born and raised in Friendswood, Texas, a Houston-suburb that is approximately 25 minutes south of Downtown. I was raised with my parents and my two older siblings, Shyam and Ram, both brothers; in other words, I am the youngest of three brothers.. lucky me!</p>

<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
   At UT, I am involved with several different organizations, including Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, University Finance Association, and Texas Business Law Association. I look forward to the years to come in my education here at UT, and for all the memories and opportunities yet to have been made.  Included below is my favorite website and also a few pictures of me, my friends, and family!</p>
